## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2) What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   My biggest challenge I encountered when creating this submission, was finding a way to speed up the time after each turn to make
   the game a bit harder. I know I had to change "clueHoldTime" from a contant to a variable and find a way to update it in the playSequence
   function so that it decreased on each turn. I had to play around with updating the "clueHoldTime" variable a few times to get it
   right. Sometime it would go way too quick after each turn and sometimes it would go a bit slow, so I ultimatly decided to shave off 13 each
   turn.

3) What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   How can you connect the front-end to the back-end part of web development?
   What are some other things a web developer should know apart from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
   Would you recommend web development to someone who loves tech and creativity and visuals?
   What would you consider the biggest learning block in learning web development?
   Whatâ€™s the biggest difference between developing for mobile and desktop?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   This project helped me learn a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a whole. If I had a few more hours to work on this project, it would have
   been great to make this game a bit more personal to whoever is playing, such as letting the user enter his/her name in a form. And whether
   or not the user won or not it print out "Congrats 'user name' you won!" or "Sorry 'user name' you lost." I would also had liked to the optional
   ticking clock feature, and maybe recording and the diplaying 'the fastest time the user completed and won the game' on the project.
